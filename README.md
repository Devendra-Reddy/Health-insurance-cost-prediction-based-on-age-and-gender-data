# Health Insurance Cost Prediction

## Overview
The **Health Insurance Cost Prediction** project aims to estimate individual medical insurance costs based on key attributes such as age and gender. By leveraging machine learning models, this project provides insights for individuals and insurance companies to better understand and predict healthcare expenses.

## Features
- Predictive model for estimating insurance costs.
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering for real-world health data.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify key cost-driving factors.
- Utilization of machine learning algorithms like Linear Regression.
- Model evaluation using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes the following features:
- **Age**: Age of the insured individual.
- **Gender**: Male or Female.
- **Charges**: Medical insurance cost (target variable).

**Note:** Provide details on how to access the dataset if publicly available or include instructions for accessing it.

## Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd Health_Insurance_Cost_Prediction-main
   ```
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: .\env\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Open the project notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Health_Insurance_Cost_Prediction.ipynb
   ```
2. Follow the steps in the notebook to preprocess data, train models, and evaluate performance.
3. Modify the notebook or scripts as needed for further experimentation.

## Results
- Key insights from EDA:
  - Age and gender are significant predictors of medical expenses.
- Model performance:
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE): **X**
  - R-squared: **Y**

## Future Improvements
- Incorporate additional features such as BMI, smoking status, and region for improved accuracy.
- Explore advanced machine learning models like Decision Trees and Random Forests.
- Develop a user-friendly interface for real-time cost predictions.
